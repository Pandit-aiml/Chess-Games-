# Chess-Games-
The Chess Game using Python is a desktop-based two-player board game designed to simulate the classic strategy game of chess in a digital environment. The project utilizes Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface (GUI), NumPy for efficient data handling and board representation, and Matplotlib for visualizing game statistics such as moves and captures.

The system provides an interactive platform where two players can play chess alternately on the same computer. Each piece’s movement follows the official chess rules, and the game accurately validates moves, detects captures, and maintains turn order. The GUI is designed to be user-friendly, displaying the chessboard, pieces, and move logs in an organized layout using the ScrolledText widget.

The main goal of this project is to integrate logic, interface, and visualization into a single Python application. The chessboard is represented as an 8×8 NumPy array, allowing efficient tracking and updating of piece positions. The captured pieces and player moves are logged and analyzed graphically through Matplotlib charts, providing insights into gameplay progress.

This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Python as a modern programming language capable of combining data processing, visualization, and GUI design seamlessly. It not only recreates the traditional chess experience digitally but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements such as AI-based opponents, online gameplay, and automated move prediction.
